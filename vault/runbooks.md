# Runbooks

> Standard operating procedures for common tasks and incidents.

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run tests
echo 'no test script'

# Run linting
eslint .

# Build
next build
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The pipeline is integrated with Cortex memory:
- Every PR auto-generates documentation in `vault/`
- CI results stored as episodic memories (searchable)
- Hybrid RRF search finds similar past PRs
- `cortex doctor` validates the local operating state
- `cortex validate-docs` checks vault markdown integrity before merge

### Pipeline Status

Check GitHub Actions: [Actions Tab](../../actions)

## Common Issues

### Tests Failing in CI

1. Run tests locally: `echo 'no test script'`
2. Check for environment differences
3. Search Cortex for similar failures: `cortex search "test failure"`

### Lint Errors

1. Run lint locally: `eslint .`
2. Auto-fix if possible: `eslint . --fix` (if supported)
3. Check lint rules configuration

### Deployment Issues

1. Check deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Search Cortex for past deployment issues: `cortex search "deploy"`

## Security Procedures

- Dependency vulnerabilities: `npm audit` or `pip audit`
- Secret rotation procedures
- Incident response checklist

## Governance Quick Checks

```bash
cortex doctor
cortex webgraph doctor --project-root .
cortex validate-docs --vault vault
```

## Adding a New Runbook

Add new procedures to this file or create separate files in `vault/runbooks/`.
Link them here using [[wiki-links]].
