# Cortex Enterprise Runbook

> Shared operating model for small-to-medium engineering teams using Cortex.

## Role Onboarding

### DevOps

- Run `cortex setup pipeline` in the governed repository.
- Validate baseline health with `cortex doctor`.
- Wire CI to run `cortex verify-docs` and `cortex validate-docs`.
- Keep `.memory/` local-only and never publish Chroma state.

### Developers

- Start with `cortex-sync` before implementation work.
- Persist specs in `vault/specs/` and session outcomes in `vault/sessions/`.
- Use `cortex search` and `cortex context` before repeating old work.
- Use branch namespaces when the repository has long-lived parallel work.

### Analysts

- Use `cortex webgraph serve --project-root <repo>` for one project.
- Use `cortex webgraph serve --workspace-file .cortex/webgraph/workspace.yaml` for multi-project analysis.
- Filter WebGraph by project, node type and recent activity to reduce noise.

### Staff / Tech Leads

- Review `vault/decisions/` for architectural drift.
- Keep `vault/runbooks/` current when delivery or operations change.
- Decide explicitly whether session notes are Git-tracked in your team policy.

## Daily Checks

```bash
cortex doctor
cortex validate-docs --vault vault
```

## Release and Incident Readiness

- Confirm `vault/specs/`, `vault/decisions/`, `vault/runbooks/` and `vault/hu/` are current.
- Confirm local-only state remains outside Git (`.memory/`, transient session churn if your policy ignores it).
- Re-run `cortex doctor --strict` before publishing tooling changes.
